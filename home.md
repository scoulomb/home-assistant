Control HEOS directly via native integration: play URL
But can have all feature via REST call and API server made in: https://github.com/open-denon-heos/
Use this https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rest_command/

For Phlips relationship: no need to integrate API used Home Assistant directy
<!-- https://github.com/open-denon-heos/discovery/tree/main/heos_docker_initial_project#improvement -->

Use home assistant for alarm clock via AVR rather than conjob trigger in NAS
