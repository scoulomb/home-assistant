# QNAP HBS

Once extension setup (see [setup](./extension-setup.md)) we create 2 one way sync job

## Setup job

Sync 
- /homes/admin/scoulomb-data
- /home/admin/QobuzDonwloads 

to TR-002 unit/nas-sync 

And tick use extension unit


We use 2 different job 
<!--ccl -->
<!-- format worked as pop up and timestmap in qfile-->


##  HBS implications with reformat


- Resetup job in HBS
- Or just re-create the destination folder


## Launch 

Launch 2 in parallel, stuck at 5%
So relaunch 1 by 1, it worked (but seems could work also in parallel, as qobuz was also stuck at 5%)

Eject device at end (top rigth in main screen)

<!-- ccl ok -->
