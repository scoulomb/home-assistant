# File sharing 

Leveraging knowledge on DNS + Cert in [DNS.md](./DNS.md).
We will now understand file sharing option.

Note in `NAS` > `myQNAPCloud` app we will have a look at `access control` and `myQNAP cloud link (`DDNS` and `SSL cert`` section were reviewed in [DNS.md](./DNS.md))

<!-- file sharing using IP OK: https://github.com/scoulomb/home-assistant/commit/75b194975ff8e2dd2830680b6c2b4a6d399e0474, no come back ok -->

Reminder NAT rules defined [DNS.md intro](../DNS.md#nat-port-note) => see [README](../../README.md#solution-1-double-dnat) <!-- clear and ccl-->
